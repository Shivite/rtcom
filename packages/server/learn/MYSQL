Duplicate with count
Select name, count(*) from test.contacts group by name having count(name)>1;

Select * from table order by desc limit 10;

Select l.name from test.lawyers as l join test.lawyerreviews  as lr on l.id = lr.lawyers_id;
Explain select * prd_id, prd_name from products where prd_code = "xyz"; 

Create index indexName on product_code(pc);

alter table test.contacts add index cn(name);
Create index indexName on column(key);
Primary Index: Automatically created on the primary key.
Unique Index: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
Regular Index: Speeds up retrieval but allows duplicate values.
Full-Text Index: Used for full-text searches.

Explain to check the execution behaviour of a query.
Explain extended   provide more detailed information about query.
Show warnings: give additional details also.

Slow query log/ Enabling General Query Log: we can enable slow query log by using .conf or .ini we also can use the set global variable also

slow_query_log = 1
slow_query_log_file = /var/log/mysql/slow-query.log
long_query_time = 2

SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'ON';
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log_file = '/var/log/mysql/slow-query.log';
SET GLOBAL long_query_time = 2;

Transactions and acid prop:
Transaction: multiple mysql statements/query execution as a single unit.
A atmocity: All or nothin
C Consistency: transaction transform the db from one consistant state to another state.
I Isolation: While execution one transaction will be isolated from other till the time it completed. States of one Transaction	is hidden from other.
D Durability: Once the transaction completed it will be permanent event in the case of failure.ss

START TRANSACTION;
Update product set balance = balance -1 where id =1;
Update set product set balance = balance-2 where id=2;
Commit;

Deadlock: one transaction waiting on other to be completed and timeout happen. 
Avoid: 
Transaction timeout, innodb automatically detect the deadlock & rollback
Avoid complex nested transactions.

stored procedure:
Are recompiled mysql statements, executed them by calling name of procedure with specified params. 
ADV: Precomilled so fast to execute, more secure we can call like mehtods, reusability.

Create procedure procedurename(IN emp_id INT)
BEGIN
	select * from table,
END
